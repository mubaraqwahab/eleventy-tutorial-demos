A peanut is a plant in the legume family, _Fabaceae_.
Peanuts are annual herbaceous plants growing 30 to 50 cm (1 to 1.5 ft) tall.

The peanut plant flowers above ground, then develops its pods underground.
Because of this, peanuts are often called groundnuts.

A nut is a hard shelled fruit that comes from a plant whose fruit does not open to release its seed.
A nut is a composite of the fruit and seed,
some examples of true nuts are: acorns, beechnuts, chestnuts and hazelnuts.
So despite the name, the plant is not a nut in the biological sense, but a legume.
